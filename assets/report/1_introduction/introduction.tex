\section{Introduction}
This assignment involves implementing genetic programming to evolve a model for forecasting COVID-19 infections, deaths and recoveries for a particular day.

More specifically, the toolset provided by ECJ \cite{luke2006ecj}, A java-based evolutionary computation research system, was used to construct a genetic programming approach to solving the above-mentioned problem as a time-series analysis problem.
